# MULE Central Program
The main programs running on the MULE to manage information

# Summary
The MULE (Modular Underwater Linked Explorer) is a remotely controlled underwater drone. The MULE was created as a final year interdisciplinary engineering capstone project with work from a group of mechanical, electrical, geomatics, and software engineering discipline students.

The overall solution consisted of four main components
- An operational, underwater vehicle
- A standardized system for attaching scientific data sensors
- A social network for citizen science and a database for sensor reading
- An application for remotely controlling the underwater vehicle

This git project contains the software solutions for a data program to collect sensor information, a central program for managing remote controls on the drone, and a drone positioning solution.
